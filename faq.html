            <h4 align="left" class="h4a">My laptop is not taking power and i believe the charging port is faulty, you gave me an estimate, i’ve sent the laptop for repair but now you want to charge me more money, why is that?</h4>
            <p align="left" class="h4b">We gave you an estimate based on your fault description, but the laptop turns up to have a motherboard fault, not a charging port fault, then it will be a extra charge for that.</p>

            <h4 align="left" class="h4a">We fixed a phone with you but without dropping the phone , the screen got cracked by itself. Can this be replaced under warranty?</h4>
            <p align="left" class="h4b">This is physical damage and is not covered by the warranty, however, we can give you a discount for the next one.</p>

            <h4 align="left" class="h4a">You replaced my phone screen but the screen got cracked even if i had a glass screen protector.</h4>
            <p align="left" class="h4b">A screen protector can give the screen assembly more solid, but it will not protect your screen in a case a tricky/bad drop.</p>

            <h4 align="left" class="h4a">I have a usb stick and I asked for data recovery but you are charging more than the usb stick price. Is it normal to charge more than the device price?</h4>
            <p align="left" class="h4b">The device price doesn’t reflect the job price, i understand a usb stick is cheap these days but the work we put on it to recover the data, can easily reach hours, that’s why a data recover job, has the most unpredictable ending (time/money).</p>
